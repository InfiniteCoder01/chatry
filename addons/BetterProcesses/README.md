# Better Processes

TODO, add tutorial


# TODO!

- [ ] Enviroment Varibles? Set them? Reset them? add to them? Figure that process out.
- [ ] Make Process/ProcessNodes resetable?
- [ ] Should Process be a *Resource* (instead of just a RefCounted)? Might give it some useful export features...
- [x] collect return codes
